Let me start off by saying that I am a big supporter of the _idea_ behind [App.Net](http://app.net) and I have a lot of respect for Dalton and the guys behind it - it's great. [An article I read this morning](https://medium.com/future-tech-future-market/81dd36429f47) did get me thinking though.

I agree that the idea of having an underlying architecture that multiple social products are built upon is awesome, and that the potential benefit to users is huge, what I don't agree with is that it's good for developers (financially). As a developer, getting users to pay for (or even use) my software is a hard sell - if I power my software with something like App.Net I am essentially telling my users that they _also_ have to go buy some other product that they probably don't understand for an additional price per year (on top of whatever I do or don't charge them). At worst this means they won't consider using my otherwise attractive thing, at best it means I'm sharing a lot of potential revenue with App.Net.

App.Net's answer to this is the [Developer Incentive Program](http://blog.app.net/2012/09/27/announcing-the-app-net-developer-incentive-program/) (tl;dr: ADN will give a share of _$n_ per month to apps which users rate highly) - to me this is not a good way of making revenue. The fact remains that ADN is charging each user $36/year to use _my_ app, then allocating a set amount of money per month to pay developers with.

What I think should happen is this: users sign up to App.Net for free, and they charge me when a user signs up to my service (i.e. I pay to use their social app infrastructure on a per-user basis). This means that the developer is the customer rather than the user - I even like this approach better from the perspective of the customer having input in the direction of the product and the customer now being me.
